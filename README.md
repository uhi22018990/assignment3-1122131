### toco CSS
The website is based on HTML5 and lightweight CSS library I developed called Toco (`https://satao.page/css/toco-core.css`).
When I first developed my first CSS boilerplate in 2009, the CSS grid system at the time was known as "Fluid baseline grid".
Bootstrap was not invented yet.
I remmeber a wonderful work done by Josh Hopkins and 40 Horse with "Fluid Baseline Grid v1.0.1". (https://github.com/thedayhascome/Fluid-Baseline-Grid)
Bootstrap and Fundation are now the most famous CSS frameworks out there.
However, in my honest opinion, they are bloated like a brand new Samsung phone.
Toco shares the same spirit of pure.css (https://purecss.io/), light and simple.
In less then 3K it defines grids for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 24 columns, mobile or desktop.

### Sesto PHP library
Sesto is a library that I build since I first met PHP and start my career as self-employed web developer.
The library is an evolution of a previous framework called "Naranza Framework" which I have now dismissed.
It allows to create PHP web-based application easily whithout adding any extra layer of complexity or complicated useless OOP patterns.
Developers can create their own routing algorithm, validation, or use external libraries as they like.

## Bella CMS
With my recent works like Sesto, Bateo, Toco etc, I always asked myself how to create a beautiful documentation website.
The first idea was to use Wordpress or other CMS solutions but I rejectect all of them.
The WWW was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.
His initial goal was to facilitate the sharing and exchange of information among researchers at CERN and other academic institutions.
How many times these document were updated?
Why I need a local database, or more worse on a cloud, for show a page rarely updated?
Bella CMS permit me to publish my websites easily using the developer's best friend: the code editor.

## Satao document publishing

I need to admit that HTML is absolutely readable, but is a terrible to write by human beigns due its verbosity.
During a speak in a conference of developers I asked the question of how many remember what is the syntax of an achor in markdown.
Not surprisingly, just few hand raised.
When I asked how many remember what is the syntax of an achor in HTML, I saw all hands raised.
Satao aims to answer this problem.
It allows you to leverage your knowledge of HTML by simplifying the syntax.
