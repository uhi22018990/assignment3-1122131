## Personal reflection

Resitting a postgraduate exam can have a significant mental impact.
Surely, it is influenced by various factors including prior expectations, perceived competence, and external pressures.
It is not easy have more than 30 years of software and web development and prove it.

The third article of The Code of Professional Conduct of the Italian professional association "Periti Industriali e dei Periti Industriali Laureati della Provincia di Venezia" (Industrial Experts of Province of Venice) I am former member of says:

Research suggests that the experience may evoke feelings of disappointment, frustration, and self-doubt, particularly if the individual had high expectations or perceived themselves as competent before the initial attempt (Pitt, 2019). Moreover, the stigma associated with exam retakes can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and embarrassment (Luyckx et al., 2017).

> _"Il Perito Industriale deve assolvere gli impegni assunti con la massima coscienza e diligenza,
consapevole di dover rifiutare quegli incarichi per l'assolvimento dei quali ritenga di non essere
adeguatamente preparato, come pure quelli che potrebbero porlo in una posizione di conflitto con i
suoi doveri professionali."_

which translated should be

> _"The Industrial Expert must fulfill the commitments undertaken with the utmost conscientiousness and diligence,
aware that they must refuse those assignments for which they believe they are not adequately prepared,
as well as those that could put them in a position of conflict with their professional duties."_


Be put in a position of conflict with my professional duties, I decided to take another direction by showing a current web application I am currently developing.

### Behind satao.page

#### toco CSS
The website is based on HTML5 and lightweight CSS library I developed called Toco (`https://satao.page/css/toco-core.css`).
When I first developed my first CSS boilerplate in 2010 for what at the period was called "Fluid baseline grid", Boostrap was not invented yet.
A wonderful work has been done by Josh Hopkins and 40 Horse with "Fluid Baseline Grid v1.0.1". (https://github.com/thedayhascome/Fluid-Baseline-Grid)
Boostrap and fundation are now the most famous CSS frameworks out there.
However, they are bloated like a brand new Samsung phone.
Toco shares the same spirit of pure.css (https://purecss.io/), light and simple.
In less then 3K it defines grids for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 24 columns

#### Sesto PHP library
Sesto is a library that I build since I first met PHP and start my career as self-employed developer.
The library is an evolution of a previous framework called "Naranza Framework" which I have now dismissed.
It allows to create PHP web-based application easily whithout adding any extra layer of complexity or complicated useless OOP patterns.
Developers can create their own routing algorithm, validation, or use external libraries as they like.

### Bella CMS
With my recent works like Sesto, Bateo, Toco etc, I always asked myself how to create a beautiful documentation website.
The first idea was to use Wordpress or other CMS solutions but I rejectect all of them.
The World Wide Web was invented for sharing or theFrankly speaking I am tired to see the attitude to use large amount of technologies for writing "hello world".
The WWW was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.
His initial goal was to facilitate the sharing and exchange of information among researchers at CERN and other academic institutions.
How many times these document were updated?
Why I need a local database, or more worse on a cloud, for show a page rarely updated?
Bella CMS permit me to publish my websites easily using my best friend: Netbeans editor.

### Satao document publishing

I need to admit that HTML is absolutely readable, but is a terrible to write.
Why I need to learn a new language like Markdown or Asciidoc for publishing my document?
During a speak in a conference of developers I asked the question of how many remember what is the syntax of an achor in markdown.
Not surprisingly, just few hand raised.
When I asked how many remember what is the syntax of an achor in HTML, they all raised the hand.
Satao aims to answer this problem.
It allows you to leverage your knowledge of HTML by simplifying the syntax.
